# Destructive Testing Fixture for Composite Reflector Panels

**Objective:** Develop a destructive testing fixture to simulate wind loading and validate the structural performance of composite panels.  

**Key Achievements:**  
- Designed and modeled the test fixture in Siemens NX.  
- Conducted FEA using SimSolid to identify critical failure points, providing real-world validation for numerical results.
