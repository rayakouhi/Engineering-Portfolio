# Raya Kouhi — Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

I’m a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Toronto with experience in design, simulation, and R&D.  
This portfolio highlights some of my projects in thermal system design, CFD and FEA analysis, and product development.

## Featured Projects
- **3D Printer Chamber Temperature Control**  
  Designed and simulated a controlled heating system using CFD to maintain consistent print quality.

- **Gate Valve FEA Analysis**  
  Performed static structural tests under 255 bar rated pressure using ANSYS.

- **Automation with VBA & Python**  
  Created tools for data filtering and cross-referencing valve part numbers.
