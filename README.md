# Raya Kouhi â€” Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Iâ€™m a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University of Toronto with experience in design, simulation, and R&D.  
This portfolio highlights some of my projects in thermal system design, CFD and FEA analysis, and product development.

## Featured Projects
- **[3D Printer Chamber Temperature Control](3D_Printer_Thermal_System)**  
  Designed and simulated a controlled heating system using CFD to maintain consistent print quality.

- **[Gate Valve FEA Analysis](Gate_Valve_FEA)**  
  Performed static structural tests under 255 bar rated pressure using ANSYS.

- **[4-axis Desktop Milling Machine Design](CNC_Milling_Machine)**  
  Designed a 4-axis CNC milling machine for rapid prototyping.

- **[Destructive Testing Fixture Design & Analysis](Destructive_Testing_Fixture)**  
  Designed a test fixture in Siemens NX to simulate wind loading on composite panels and performed FEA in SimSolid to validate structural performance.
